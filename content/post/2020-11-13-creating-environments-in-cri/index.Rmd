1) Create the new environment using conda
```{sh, eval=FALSE}
conda create -n env_name
```

Make sure this command is creating a new environment in the lab share and not your own personal directory since you will run out of disk space

to specify where to install the environment use

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
conda create --prefix /gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/bin/envs/env_name 
```

2) Activate the new environment

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
conda activate env_name
```

3) Install whatever you want in your new environment. Also because the environment is in the labshare, anyone can use it just by calling

```{sh, eval=FALSE}
conda install <software>
conda activate /gpfs/data/im-lab/nas40t2/bin/envs/env_name
```
