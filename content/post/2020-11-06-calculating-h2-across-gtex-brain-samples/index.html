<p>After receiving a .RAR file with reaction rate data for 13 brain tissue samples, we wanted to calculate h2 and see if any of the thousands of reactions were heritable.</p>
<p>These are the packages necessary to run this analysis, along with the path to the list of 13 brain tissue data sets.</p>
<p>We then created a pipeline to coalesce all 13 files into one and create the long format of that data. The pipeline is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>## Warning in read_fun(path = enc2native(normalizePath(path)), sheet_i = sheet, :
## Coercing boolean to numeric in GJ3243 / R3243C192</code></pre>
<p>This pipeline simply reads each file in the list of 13 and then creates a column to say which tissue that sample came from. Finally it creates the long format using pivot_longer()</p>
<p>Next - I created an intermediary data frame <code>x</code> that has an additional column for individual_id. I then grouped by individual_id and reaction_id and summarized.</p>
<p>The groupby() command will only include unique reaction_id/individual_id pairs so that any pairs that were common across tissues will be parsed into one and given the average value.</p>
<p>Finally, we created the wide formate of the data that can be read by gcta for h2 calculation.</p>
<p>Above, we added an additional column for Family_ID that is the same as Individual_ID. We also filtered at this step. This is important since normally we would have filtered during the pipeline step. We filtered for reaction ids whose average across the column was &lt;0.9 and &gt;0.1 so that those reactions are variable across the population.</p>
<p>We filtered here as to not introduce NAs into the wide formate of teh data since gcta could not appropriately handle NAs.</p>
<p>We can check that there are no NAs using the function below</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(apply(widedata[,-c(1,2)],2,mean))</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
##  0.1001  0.2662  0.4924  0.5048  0.7666  0.8994</code></pre>
<p>GCTA can then calculate h2 for all 2430 phenotypes.

<p>Sadly the histograms for both h2 and pvalues do not look significant.</p>
