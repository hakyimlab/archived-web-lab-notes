If you want to use the MetaXcan suite of tools, you will need to format your prediction weights in sqlite format.

Find a sample script that formats FUSION weights to predictdb format [here](https://hakyimlab.github.io/psychencode/generate_weights.html)

If you want to use the summary version of PrediXcan, you will also need the covariances between SNPs
Fine a sample script [here](https://hakyimlab.github.io/psychencode/calculate_covariances.html)
